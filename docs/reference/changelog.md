# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The changelog is automatically generated by [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) based on commit messages.

!!! info "Auto-generated Content"
    This changelog is automatically generated from commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Do not edit manually.

## How It Works

The changelog is generated automatically when:

1. Commits are pushed to the `main` branch
2. Commit messages follow Conventional Commits format
3. The semantic-release workflow determines version bumps
4. Changelog entries are created and grouped by type

### Changelog Format

Entries are organized by:

- **Version number** (following semantic versioning)
- **Release date**
- **Change type** (Features, Bug Fixes, etc.)
- **Links** to commits and pull requests

### Entry Types

| Commit Type | Changelog Section | Example |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| `feat:` | **Features** | New functionality added |
| `fix:` | **Bug Fixes** | Bugs that were fixed |
| `perf:` | **Performance** | Performance improvements |
| `revert:` | **Reverts** | Reverted changes |

!!! note "Other Types"
    Commits with types like `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, and `chore:` don't appear in the changelog but still follow Conventional Commits format.

## Understanding Versions

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer):

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

### Version Components

**MAJOR** (Breaking Changes)
- Incompatible API changes
- Breaking changes in behavior
- Requires user action to upgrade
- Triggered by: `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer or `!` after type

Example:
```bash
feat!: redesign API endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: All endpoints now require authentication
```

**MINOR** (New Features)
- New functionality added
- Backwards-compatible changes
- No breaking changes
- Triggered by: `feat:` commit type

Example:
```bash
feat: add OAuth2 authentication
```

**PATCH** (Bug Fixes)
- Bug fixes and minor improvements
- Backwards-compatible fixes
- Performance improvements
- Triggered by: `fix:`, `perf:`, `revert:` commit types

Example:
```bash
fix: resolve null pointer exception in user endpoint
```

## Changelog Best Practices

### Writing Changelog-Friendly Commits

#### Good Examples

```bash
# Clear, descriptive feature
feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication with Google and GitHub providers

# Specific bug fix
fix(api): resolve null pointer exception when user email is null

# Performance improvement
perf(db): optimize user query with database indexes
```

#### Poor Examples

```bash
# Too vague
feat: add stuff

# Not descriptive
fix: fix bug

# Wrong type (should be feat)
update: add new feature
```

### Creating Meaningful Entries

#### Include Context in Body

```bash
feat(auth): add password reset functionality

Implements password reset flow with email verification.
Users receive a time-limited reset link via email.
Includes rate limiting to prevent abuse.

Closes #142
```

This creates a detailed changelog entry:

```markdown
### Features

* **auth:** add password reset functionality ([abc123](link))

  Implements password reset flow with email verification.
  Users receive a time-limited reset link via email.
  Includes rate limiting to prevent abuse.

  Closes #142
```

#### Link Issues

Always link related issues:

```bash
feat: add user dashboard

Closes #123
Fixes #456
Refs #789
```

This creates clickable links in the changelog.

## Changelog Generation Process

### 1. Analyze Commits

Semantic-release analyzes commits since the last release:

```bash
# Commits analyzed
fix(api): resolve bug
feat(ui): add new component
docs: update README
```

### 2. Determine Version

Based on commit types:

- Has `feat:`? → Minor bump (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
- Has `fix:` only? → Patch bump (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
- Has `BREAKING CHANGE:`? → Major bump (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
- Only `docs:`, `chore:`? → No release

### 3. Generate Notes

Group commits by type:

```markdown
# [1.1.0] (2024-03-15)

### Features
* **ui:** add new component ([abc123](link))

### Bug Fixes
* **api:** resolve bug ([def456](link))
```

### 4. Update Files

- Update `CHANGELOG.md`
- Create GitHub release
- Create git tag
- Commit changes

## Customizing Changelog

### Change Grouping

Edit `.releaserc.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    ["@semantic-release/release-notes-generator", {
      "preset": "angular",
      "presetConfig": {
        "types": [
          {"type": "feat", "section": "✨ Features"},
          {"type": "fix", "section": "🐛 Bug Fixes"},
          {"type": "perf", "section": "⚡ Performance"},
          {"type": "docs", "section": "📚 Documentation", "hidden": false}
        ]
      }
    }]
  ]
}
```

### Add Emojis

```json
{
  "presetConfig": {
    "types": [
      {"type": "feat", "section": "✨ Features"},
      {"type": "fix", "section": "🐛 Bug Fixes"},
      {"type": "perf", "section": "⚡ Performance"},
      {"type": "revert", "section": "⏪ Reverts"}
    ]
  }
}
```

### Custom Commit Types

Include additional commit types:

```json
{
  "presetConfig": {
    "types": [
      {"type": "feat", "section": "Features"},
      {"type": "fix", "section": "Bug Fixes"},
      {"type": "docs", "section": "Documentation", "hidden": false},
      {"type": "style", "section": "Styling", "hidden": false},
      {"type": "refactor", "section": "Refactoring", "hidden": false}
    ]
  }
}
```

## Changelog Workflow

### For Contributors

1. **Write conventional commits**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   ```

2. **Push to branch**
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/my-feature
   ```

3. **Create pull request**
   - PR title must follow Conventional Commits
   - Changelog will be generated on merge

### For Maintainers

1. **Review and merge PR**
   - Verify PR title is conventional
   - Squash and merge (preserves PR title)

2. **Automatic release**
   - Release workflow runs automatically
   - Changelog is updated
   - GitHub release is created
   - Tag is pushed

3. **Verify release**
   - Check Releases tab
   - Verify CHANGELOG.md
   - Confirm version tag

## Viewing Changelog

### In Repository

**File:** `CHANGELOG.md` in repository root

```bash
# View locally
cat CHANGELOG.md

# View in browser
https://github.com/username/repo/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md
```

### In Releases

**GitHub Releases:** Repository → Releases tab

Each release includes:

- Version number and date

- Download links for source code

### In Documentation

**This page:** [Changelog](changelog.md)

A curated view of recent changes with context and explanations.

## Common Questions

### Why isn't my commit in the changelog?

**Reason:** Only certain commit types appear in the changelog:
- `feat:` - Appears in Features section
- `fix:` - Appears in Bug Fixes section
- `perf:` - Appears in Performance section
- Other types (`docs:`, `chore:`, etc.) are hidden by default

### How do I fix a wrong changelog entry?

**Don't edit CHANGELOG.md manually.** Instead:

1. The entry is based on commit messages
2. Use `git revert` to undo changes
3. Make a new commit with the correct message
4. The next release will include the correction

### Can I skip a release?

**Yes, using skip keywords:**

```bash
git commit -m "docs: update README [skip ci]"
```

Or in PR title:
```
docs: update README [skip release]
```

### How do I create a pre-release?

Configure beta/alpha branches in `.releaserc.json`:

```json
{
  "branches": [
    "main",
    {"name": "beta", "prerelease": true}
  ]
}
```
